This repo provides codes for training the 2d version model mentioned by our previous work `Minimally Interactive Segmentation of Unseen Objects from Medical Images Using Deep Learning [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12166.pdf)`.</br>
We have tested this code on the datesets `BTCV` and our newly published datasets [WORD](https://github.com/HiLab-git/WORD).
